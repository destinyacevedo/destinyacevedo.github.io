                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;
                When Are We Gonna Have a Serious Conversation About How Unserious (and Problematic) SIGCSE Is?&rdquo; 
                authored by Dr Nicki Washington, published by Momentum, is a short yet detailed response to criticism 
                given to the author. Dr Washington walks the audience through a reflection of the response given back 
                from reviewers at SIGCSE and to readers&#39; surprise, much of the critic was rooted in their inability 
                to understand the work proposed. The author further reflects on how specifically each reviewer spoke from 
                a perspective that stemmed from an elitist, white and ignorant point of view. As well as touching on the 
                fact that for some diversity, equity and inclusion is an act for them; it is something they do or not do when 
                it conveniently benefits them. &nbsp;

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Nicki Washington&rsquo;s main argument includes the Special 
                Interest Group in CS Education may not have the right system or participants with an ability to accurately review 
                every proposal submitted. Dr Washington uses specific and detailed examples with the use of quotes to illustrate 
                how not every reviewer associated with SIGCSE is right to serve as a reviewer for every proposal. An example of 
                this is seen when the author reflects on a comment left by a reviewer describing how due to the panelists not all 
                being full time tenure employees, this may make it hard for people to evaluate the depth of their education on the 
                topic. The author points out that to underestimate a person&#39;s ability to understand a topic based on their 
                educational status stems from an elitist mindset and speaks to the reviewer&#39;s ability to review this proposal. 
                Following, readers are then taken to another comment left by a reviewer that corrects Dr Washington&rsquo;s work 
                cited that corrects the spelling and capitalization of well known author bell hooks, who is known to never capitalize 
                their name. Which leads readers to believe, this reviewer may not actually be equipped to review this proposal, if 
                they do not know bell hooks work.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although SIGCSE has the right to review and reject proposals as their 
                company sees fit, it does bring to question the company&#39;s overall goals of a forum, if volunteers apply and receive 
                an overdone critic. It calls into question the company&rsquo;s mission statement that reflects it being a global forum 
                which insinuates diversity. But it also causes readers to reflect on their use of the word educators, since based on the 
                reviews left they have a preconceived standard as to who is considered an educator. Most importantly, readers may want to 
                think twice on attending discussions since the company&rsquo;s underlying goal is to see where the discussions can provide 
                profit to the company.
