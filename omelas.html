LeGuin is broken into three parts, first by describing an utopian society, second describing a child and lastly describing others. In the beginning, LeGuin illustrates an utopia type of society where the citizens are depicted as simple and happy despite having no modernization</span><span class="c2">. As they are not under any rulers such as monarchies, they do not enslave their people for personal gain and </span><span class="c2">have no modern economical form of currency</span><span class="c2">. </span><span class="c2">To much of readers surprise, this utopian society also runs without any formal law enforcement, and has no interest in the luxuries of technology. </span><span class="c2">Ending this first part with a slightly different tone, readers are confronted with the idea that for the people of Omelas smiles become a thing of the past and or archaic which </span><span class="c2">does not seem to align with the beginning of the story</span><span class="c2">. After the depiction of this all encompassing world is described the author transitions into the second part of the story but before doing so, LeGuin summarizes this society&#39;s ideology on happiness with statements and rhetorical questions. One statement reads as follows &ldquo;..to praise despair is to condemn delight...&rdquo; (LeGuin), which </span><span class="c2">seemed to have lacked a perspective and an appreciation for emotions like pain and despair. Giving readers a sense of what kind of values -or lack thereof- this society has for other emotions that may not be associated with a positive connotation. Leading readers, to follow up with the author and ask if people never experience negative emotions can they truly feel positive emotions such as happiness?</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Moving into the second part of the story, a child character emerges and </span><span class="c2">the unfortunate events of this person&#39;s life begin to unfold, as they are the only person truly suffering in this utopia society</span><span class="c2">. This child life is describes in great detail as to the </span><span class="c2">pain</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c2">torture</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and heart wrenching experiences they are confined to. But the child never receives any satisfaction, as the people of this society never obliged them, but instead become spectators. </span><span class="c2">Without great detail, LeGuin dismisses any opportunity to elaborate on the reasons why the child must be kept in mistreatment for the rest to be guaranteed happiness. Leading readers to believe that in Omelas, happiness has a price and it is being paid for with this child&#39;s life to be kept in misery. </span><span class="c2">LeGuin&#39;s final part is introduced to the audience, this involves characters that take a different approach to the knowledge of this &ldquo;wretched one&rdquo;(LeGuin) which encompasses their drive to leave. Not much is said by the author as to why or what may have been the motives to picking up and never returning, leaving readers to compile their own. </span><span class="c7">Author LeGuin narrates the story of Omelas to form a well calculated story that is both informative and vague to the details of this society; allowing readers an opportunity to conceive their own ethical and moral opinion about the principles characters in Omelas live by. </span><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0">Citation </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c2">LeGuin, Ursula K. </span><span class="c2 c5">The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas</span><span class="c2">. pp. 1-5.</span></p></body></html>
