These conditions are described as a creation of natural variation in brain wiring and is further referred to as neurodivergence. Boorgu writes about the difficulties people with neurodivergence can experience in everyday environments, and how it can seem like they are always trying to keep up with their neurotypical peers in settings such as schools. They further describe how AI is helping minimize the gap between neurodivergent people and their neurotypical peers through devices such as the InnerVoice app and AI powered tools. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Much of the author&#39;s argument includes people with neurodivergence experience a great disadvantage in settings such as schools and in workplaces but through the help of AI powered tools they are able to reach new success in the community.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1">Boorgu supports this with examples detailing the experiences for people with success in using AI powered tools. An example of this is seen through the depiction of the InnerVoice app, which is an AI power tool that helps people connect objects with words or language. The features seem endless as to the possibilities the device can do to benefit its user, such as explaining concepts and depicting movements using gifs. Most notable is the example of text-to-speech feature which is described as being especially useful to nonverbal children, helping to connect speech and reality. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the author creates a very just argument, Boorgu also leaves readers with questions as to the reality of creating AI powered devices. The author describes to readers that with the increased popularity of AI, comes the increased demand for developing algorithms to power these devices. Which at first does not seem out of place, but the author also illustrates that the pool of people with said skills to develop algorithms is shrinking or is not staffed efficiently. This has caused companies to maximize the talents of employees, in hopes that in the future there will be new talents to help. This lack of employees meeting the demand of companies seems to be a growing problem in the technology industry, where due to the ratio of talents to job opportunities, many are overworked. Which can cause further implications to the field and to the potential talents seeking employment such as hostile work environments, burnout and a greater chance of exploitation of employees. </span><span class="c2 c5">For many industries including tech, growth often comes at the risk of exploiting talents, there needs to be a sustainable way to meet consumers&#39; needs and demands that is not at the cost of employees.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, author Malini Boorgu describes by using examples the ways in which AI power tools have the potential to benefit a community of neurodivergent people who are empowered by the groundbreaking algorithms that are fueling the technology. Throughout the article the author makes claims to the future that with the continued help of AI there will be more opportunities for the neurodivergent community. The author further their claims by discussing the changes that the neurodivergent community has brought into the workplace. But, what must be noted when thinking of the future, is how we might continue to progress in a sustainable way in which the technology industry and companies can meet the needs of the community, without exploiting the creators along the way. </span></p></body></html>
